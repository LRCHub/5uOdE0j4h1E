You know the sound, you got the feeling,
You know there's no going back
It's all you see, all you believe
You must have that sound
You gotta rock, and get down
Some crazy dreams, make your head spin round
Let's rock and get down
You heard the word, now it's all over town
Out in the streets, the kids stand and wait their time
Tell me how do you feel, do you wanna rock tonight
Are you ready, are you ready to rock
Tell me you're ready, tell me you're ready to rock!
There's no mistake, no denying
We're just one of a kind, there's no conceit
Seems like we're all black sheep
Abiding our time, you wanna rock and get down
Love that sound, makes our heads, Spin round and round
Let's rock and get down
I said the word, now gather around!
Out in the streets, the lights hit nameless crowd
Black n'silver mystique
Beam on a face with grace, and shout out.
Are you ready are you ready to rock
Tell me you're ready, tell me you're ready to rock!
