My name is Tom and I'm funky
(Beatsteaks, Beatsteaks, Beatsteaks, Beatsteaks)

I won't shake my ass
I won't rock the desk
I won't hold a mask
And I do confess

I come clean
I use vaseline
So fuck the scene
Know what I mean?
Know what I mean?

Oh, my god this band is tight
Oh, my god I cannot hide
I'm not ready to rock.
I'm not ready to rock.
Oh, my god this band is tight
Oh, my god

I'm not ready to rock.
I'm not ready to rock.
I'm not ready to rock.
